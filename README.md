Add the following elements to the container using ONLY JavaScript and the DOM methods shown above.

1. a <p> with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”

2. an <h3> with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”

3. a <div> with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
another <h1> that says “I’m in a div”

4. a <p> that says “ME TOO!”
Hint for this one: after creating the <div> with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the container.
